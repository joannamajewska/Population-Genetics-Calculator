# Population-Genetics-Calculator 
is a Shiny application created for the student project (as part of the biostatistics subject).
Having available genotypic data (i.e. the number of individual genotypes or an .xls file containing genotypes in individual columns), the application allows performing all necessary calculations (along with the Chi - square test) to determine whether:
1. the population is in the equilibrium of Hardy Weinberg (Hardy - Weinberg Equilibrium)
2. there is a relationship between the test group and the control group (Case - Control Studies)
3. there is a linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphisms (Linkage Disequilibrium)
